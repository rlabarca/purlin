## Purpose

<One paragraph: what invariants or constraints this anchor node enforces and why they exist.>

## <Domain> Invariants

### <Invariant Group Name>

- <Invariant statement>

## Scenarios

No automated or manual scenarios. This is a policy anchor node — its "scenarios" are
process invariants enforced by instruction files and tooling.

## Implementation Notes

This anchor node defines <process/architectural/design> invariants. There is no buildable
implementation. Compliance is enforced through <describe enforcement mechanism>.
