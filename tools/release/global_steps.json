Synthesize a concise bulleted suggestion list from the above data, grouping by theme (features, fixes, process changes) where possible.\n4. Present the suggestions to the user: 'Suggested release notes since <last-tag> — paste any you would like to include, edit freely, or write your own:'\n5. Ask the user for: (a) the new version number (e.g., 'v1.2.0'), and (b) their release notes (free text; they may copy from suggestions, combine, or replace entirely).\n6. Insert a new entry into README.md under a '## Releases' heading (create if absent). Format: `### <version> \u2014 <YYYY-MM-DD>\\n\\n<confirmed release notes text>`."
