# Release Notes

## v0.9.1 — Vitest reporter & JS/TS audit fixes

Bug-fix release addressing two reported issues in JavaScript/TypeScript proof handling.

### Fixed

- **Vitest reporter silently emitted zero proofs on Vitest 2.x+ (#1).** `scripts/proof/vitest_purlin.ts` collected proofs in `onTaskUpdate`, whose pack shape changed in Vitest 2 (`[id, result, meta]`, where `result` lacks `name`/`file`), so the marker regex never matched and tests passed with no `.proofs-*.json` written. The reporter now collects in `onFinished(files)` via a recursive file→suite→test walk — the hook whose shape is stable across Vitest 2.x–4.x — mapping `result.state` to pass/fail, skipping unrun tasks, and resolving `test_file` from the file task's `filepath`.
- **All Vitest projects now scaffold the native `vitest_purlin.ts`.** Vitest never calls Jest's `onTestResult`/`onRunComplete` hooks, so the previous "Vitest → `jest_purlin.js`" mapping was also silently broken. Vitest loads `.ts` reporters natively via Vite, so one reporter covers both JS and TS projects.
- **`check_js` audit regex misfired on common Vitest patterns (#2).** `scripts/audit/static_checks.py::check_js()` used a lazy `(.*?)\}\s*\)` body matcher that truncated at the first inner `}` (options objects, destructured params, type assertions) and a `[^"']*` title class that dropped titles containing apostrophes. Replaced with a stdlib brace-balancing tokenizer that tracks string/template/regex literals and comments.
- **Claude plugin manifest version lagged the release.** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — the version consumers install against via the plugin marketplace — was left at `0.9.0`. It now reads `0.9.1`, and a new guard (`purlin_version` RULE-5 / PROOF-5) asserts the manifest version stays in lockstep with the `VERSION` file, joining the existing `templates/config.json` check so this can't silently recur.

### Testing

- PROOF-29 was strengthened to actually drive the compiled reporter via a synthetic Vitest 2.x+ task tree (the old proof only ran `tsc` + `node` on hand-built JSON and never invoked the reporter). New regression proofs cover the exact issue #2 repro.
- Docs aligned: `references/supported_frameworks.md` (Format-Version 3), `references/formats/proofs_format.md`, and `docs/testing-workflow-guide.md` now describe the native Vitest reporter and tested version range.

## v0.9.0 — Rule-Proof Runtime

Complete redesign. Purlin v0.9.0 replaces the v1 system (35 skills, 5 agents, 8 hooks, 8 MCP tools) with a minimal rule-proof runtime.

### What Changed

**Specs replace features.** The `features/` directory and its companion files (`.impl.md`, scenarios, Given/When/Then) are gone. Specs live in `specs/<category>/<name>.md` using a 3-section format: `## What it does`, `## Rules`, `## Proof`. Rules are numbered (`RULE-N`), proofs map to rules (`PROOF-N (RULE-N)`).

**Proofs replace tests.json.** Test runners emit `*.proofs-*.json` files next to specs. Proof markers in tests: `@pytest.mark.proof("feature", "PROOF-1", "RULE-1")` for pytest, `[proof:feature:PROOF-1:RULE-1:tier]` in Jest test titles, `purlin_proof()` for shell.

**`sync_status` replaces `purlin_scan`.** One MCP tool reads specs and proof files, diffs them, reports coverage with `→` directives that tell the agent exactly what to do.

**Verification is new.** `purlin:verify` runs all tests, issues receipts for features with 100% rule coverage. `vhash = sha256(sorted RULE IDs + sorted proof IDs/statuses)`.

**12 skills** (down from 35). All optional — no skill invocation required to write any file.

**2 hard gates** (down from 8). Invariant write protection + proof coverage for receipts.

**2 MCP tools:** `sync_status`, `purlin_config`.

**2 hooks:** `PreToolUse` gate for invariants, `SessionStart` for cleanup.

**1 agent** (down from 5). No modes, no role-based permissions.

### Key Differences from v1

| v1 | v0.9.0 |
|----|--------|
| `features/<category>/<name>.md` | `specs/<category>/<name>.md` |
| Scenarios (Given/When/Then) | Rules (RULE-N) + Proofs (PROOF-N) |
| `tests/<feature>/tests.json` | `specs/<category>/<feature>.proofs-<tier>.json` |
| 3 modes (PM, Engineer, QA) | 1 agent, no modes |
| `purlin_scan` + `purlin_status` | `sync_status` |
| Role-based permissions | No permissions (skills are optional) |
| 35 skills | 12 skills |
| Write guard with file classifications | Gate hook for invariants only |

### New in v0.9.0

- **Invariants with external sources:** `> Source:` + `> Pinned:` metadata. Git-sourced and Figma-sourced. Auto-sync with `purlin:invariant sync`.
- **Manual proof stamps:** `@manual(email, date, commit_sha)` in spec's `## Proof` section. Staleness detection via `> Scope:` file tracking.
- **Verification receipts:** `*.receipt.json` files with `vhash` and commit SHA. `--audit` mode for CI.
- **Feature-scoped proof overwrite:** Each test run replaces only its feature's entries in the proof file, preserving others.

### Tier Rename (0.9.0)

- `default` → `unit` (isolated logic, controlled inputs)
- `slow` → `integration` (real dependencies — DB, APIs, filesystem)
- `e2e` and `manual` unchanged
- Rename your proof files: `*.proofs-default.json` → `*.proofs-unit.json`
- Update pytest markers: `@pytest.mark.slow` → `@pytest.mark.integration`
- Update jest markers: tier segment in `[proof:...]` tag
- Update shell env var: `PURLIN_PROOF_TIER=slow` → `PURLIN_PROOF_TIER=integration`

### MCP Server Spec Split (0.9.0)

- `specs/mcp/mcp_server.md` (34 rules) split into 4 focused specs:
  - `mcp_transport.md` (7 rules) — JSON-RPC transport
  - `sync_status.md` (15 rules) — rule coverage reporting
  - `drift.md` (11 rules) — structured change summary
  - `purlin_config.md` (1 rule) — config read/write
- Tool names: `sync_status`, `purlin_config`, `drift`

### Teammate Spawning Now Invisible (0.9.0)

- "team up" / "create a purlin team" removed as user-facing concept
- Teammates are automatically spawned by verify and audit
- Auditor, builder, reviewer still exist as agents — just no longer user-managed

### Migration

Keep your old `features/` directory — `purlin:spec-from-code` detects it and migrates your existing specs to the new 3-section format. Old scenarios and rules are used as primary input for generating new-format specs, so you don't lose the work you've already done. Remove only the non-spec artifacts (`rm -rf .purlin/ pl-* *.sh`), then run `purlin:init` followed by `purlin:spec-from-code`.
