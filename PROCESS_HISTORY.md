# Agentic Process History (Core Framework)

This log tracks the evolution of the **Agentic DevOps Core** framework itself. This repository serves as the project-agnostic engine for Spec-Driven AI workflows.

## [2026-02-18] v1.0.0 Framework Bootstrap
- **Project Decoupling:** Successfully isolated the agentic workflow from the LPad project context.
- **Universal Role Definitions:** Generalised Architect and Builder instructions to remove project-specific and agent-specific (branding) references.
- **Role-Based Interaction:** Established "The Architect," "The Builder," and "The Human Executive" as the primary roles.
- **Core Philosophy:** Codified the "Code is Disposable" philosophy into a standalone framework.
- **Meta-Process Governance:** Applied the Spec-Driven Workflow to the core framework itself.
- **Directory Structure:** Established `features/` and `tools/` as the primary directories for framework evolution.
