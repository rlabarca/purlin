# Agentic Process History (Core Framework)

This log tracks the evolution of the **Agentic DevOps Core** framework itself. This repository serves as the project-agnostic engine for Spec-Driven AI workflows.

## [2026-02-18] v1.0.1 Tool Refinement & Custom Port Isolation
- **Configuration Isolation:** Refactored CDD and Software Map tools to respect `.agentic_devops/config.json`, enabling custom port mapping (9086/9087) to avoid system-wide conflicts.
- **Meta-Mode Support:** Enhanced CDD Monitor to dynamically hide the "Application" domain when `is_meta_agentic_dev` is set to true.
- **Instruction Refinement:** Updated `agent_architect_instructions.md` and `agent_builder_instructions.md` feature specifications to include Context Recovery Protocol, Team Orchestration (delegation), and standardized reporting requirements.
- **Tool Stability:** Verified background execution and port listening status for core DevOps tools.
- **Software Map Fixes:** 
    - Resolved Python syntax error in `generate_tree.py` (multiline strings).
    - Fixed Mermaid graph file paths to ensure correct serving relative to `index.html`.
    - Implemented dynamic tab hiding in Software Map based on `is_meta_agentic_dev` config.
