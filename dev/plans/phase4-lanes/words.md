# Lane `words` (phase 4, fan-out 1)

You are lane `words` of phase 4 of Purlin 0.10.0: sanity check 3 applied, with the owner's
answers of decision 98. Purlin is a Claude Code plugin for spec-driven development that uses
itself. This brief is complete in itself; the files below are where its words come from. No
reviewer follows you: you check your own work with the self-check at the end and report.

- Worktree: `/Users/richlabarca/LocalCode/purlin-wt/p4-words`, branch `p4/words`, created from
  `main` after P1 merged:
  `git -C /Users/richlabarca/LocalCode/purlin worktree add /Users/richlabarca/LocalCode/purlin-wt/p4-words -b p4/words main`.
- Scratch folder: `<the scratchpad directory your session gives>/p4-words`.
  Nothing of yours goes anywhere else outside the worktree.

## Read first

1. `CLAUDE.md`, `references/writing_style.md`, `references/spec_quality_guide.md`,
   `references/glossary.md`.
2. `dev/plans/three-levels.md` decisions 94 to 98 (decision 98 holds the answers of sanity check
   3); a later decision amends an earlier one.
3. `dev/plans/phase4-plan.md` sections 1, 4 (your row), 5, 6 and 11, and
   `dev/plans/phase4-contracts.md` whole: every line you print or quote is there, word for word.
4. `sanity-3.md` sections 6 (items 28, 38, 43, 45) and 11 (questions 10, 12, 13, 15).
5. `references/glossary.md`, `references/purlin_commands.md`, `references/hard_gates.md`,
   `references/writing_style.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md` ("Unreleased — 0.10.0") whole.

Section references such as "§6 item 5" are to `dev/plans/sanity-3.md`; "A<n>" is the owner's
answer <n> of decision 98; K-numbers are sections of the contracts.

## The files you own

You write these and no other file. Every other file is read-only for you, the frozen helpers
included: `dev/skill_checks.py`, `dev/mcp_project.py`, `dev/sign_project.py`,
`dev/run_project.py`, `dev/reports_project.py`, `dev/conftest.py`, `dev/fake_claude.py`.

- `references/glossary.md`
- `references/purlin_commands.md`
- `references/hard_gates.md`
- `references/writing_style.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md`

## The work

Build every item. Each names its source and the change; where it names a contract, the contract
is the words.

1. **The glossary** (K5.1): `runner file`, `scope`, `anchor`; and
   `<System>: no run yet` wherever it quotes the reason (K3.8).
2. **The writing style** (A13; K5.2): the one sentence.
3. **The command reference** (K5.9 whole; A10, A12, A15; §6 item 38): the init row and prose,
   the `purlin:test` syntax, the CI-job sentence without `arm`, the no-test-tool line, the
   remote lines. Keep every `| Command | Purpose |` row: every skill's test reads
   them.
4. **`references/hard_gates.md`**: the gate question (scaffold-2),
   `<System>: no run yet` (K3.8), and any sentence letting `> Requires:` name a
   feature spec reads anchors (A8).
5. **The release notes** (K5.10): the seven lines, under "Unreleased — 0.10.0".
6. **`CLAUDE.md`**: read it against this phase; nothing is planned to change. Change a line only
   where this phase made it false, and report it.

**You produce** for other lanes: K5.1, K5.2, K5.9, K5.10.

**You consume**: every lane's words, merged before you (you merge last).

## How to number, split and write proofs (contracts K7)

- A new id is one more than the highest the spec has ever held: the larger of its
  `> Highest-Rule:` and the highest of its own `RULE-`/`PROOF-` ids in
  `git log -p --follow -- <spec>` (its own lines only, not ids a proof or another
  spec names). A deleted number is never reused. Every spec you own carries
  `> Highest-Rule: <n>` after its last other `>` line, raised with every rule you add.
- Every proof you write or reword holds one case (one starting situation, one action, what is
  seen) in at most 60 words; a list of like inputs sharing one action and one kind of result is
  one case. It names no source file, no test and no test framework; a library's public names and
  error types may appear. It has a test of its own with `# purlin: <feature> PROOF-<n>`
  (in the file's comment syntax) directly above it.
- A statement of `sanity-3.md` section 5 gets a rule and one proof per line or case, each
  quoting the printed line character for character as the code prints it after your change.
- Split a rule of yours where its text states two claims whose proofs fall into groups each
  showing one: the first claim keeps the id, each other claim takes a new id, proofs keep their
  ids and text and only their `(RULE-N)` changes. List each split.
- Delete outright what is retired: no test that a removed thing is absent, nothing added to
  `dev/test_vocabulary.py`.
- A format you change updates its file under `references/formats/` in the same commit, with the
  Format-Version K4 names (none but the spec format changes number).

## How to test

```
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/dotnet@8/bin:$PATH
cd /Users/richlabarca/LocalCode/purlin-wt/p4-words
.venv/bin/python -m pytest dev/test_skill_spec.py dev/test_purlin_agent.py -q
bash dev/run_tests.sh --fast
```

If `.venv` is missing in the worktree, use
`/Users/richlabarca/LocalCode/purlin/.venv/bin/python`. Do not run the full sweep; integration
runs it once. A failure in a test file you do not own: check the contracts' K6. If K6 predicts
it, leave it; otherwise report the test, its assertion and the value it saw. Never edit that
file.

## Limits

- Commit on `p4/words` only, with the prefixes of `references/commit_conventions.md`, each
  message ending with the attribution lines your session gives. Push nothing, tag nothing, open
  no pull request.
- Run no `purlin:audit` and no `purlin:sign`; never start the real `claude` program, a real git
  host, `gh`, `az` or any network service.
- Stage no generated file: `scripts/report/purlin-report.html`, `purlin-report.html`,
  `.purlin/evidence/**`, `.purlin/tests.md`, `.purlin/report-data.js`,
  `.github/workflows/purlin.yml`, `docs/images/**`.
- Keep each skill and `agents/purlin.md` within its line ceiling (status 100, test 120, build
  130, init 250, audit 105, sign 185, export 90, spec 210, spec-from-code 130, drift 150, anchor
  160, agent 135): a change cuts as many lines as it adds.
- A call no decision or contract makes: build the rest, leave that thing as it is, report it. A
  word a person reads that the contracts do not give: do not choose it; leave the line as it is
  and report it.
- Do not touch `/Users/richlabarca/LocalCode/purlin-wt/winfix-1`, `docs/` or `README.md`.
- Before you finish: `git rebase main`, rerun your files and `--fast`, fix your own files
  where a lane merged earlier changed a result K6 predicts.

## Self-check (run it, then report each result)

1. Every proof you wrote or reworded: one case, at most 60 words (count them), and a test of its
   own with its marker directly above it. List any that fails.
2. Every printed line you built or quote: character for character as K2 and K3 give it. Grep
   your files for each old form in K2 for your lane; none remains.
3. No generated file is staged: `git diff --cached --name-only main` names none of
   `scripts/report/purlin-report.html`, `purlin-report.html`, `.purlin/evidence/**`,
   `.purlin/tests.md`, `.purlin/report-data.js`, `.github/workflows/purlin.yml`,
   `docs/images/**`.
4. No id reused: for each spec you own, every RULE and PROOF id you added is above the highest
   that spec had ever held before you began (K7), and its `> Highest-Rule:` is its highest
   rule number now.
5. Break each of these on purpose, one at a time, run its test, see it fail, then restore the
   file with `git checkout -- <file>` (never `git checkout -- specs/`): (a)
   restore the old gate question in `hard_gates.md`: skill_init's or skill_spec's quote check
   fails if one reads it; if none does, say so; (b) remove a `| Command | Purpose |`
   row: a skill test fails; (c) restore "It commits nothing.": no test reads it; say so in the
   report.

## Report, as your final message

- The branch and its commits (sha and subject).
- For each spec you own: its highest RULE and PROOF id, its `> Highest-Rule:`, and its rule
  and proof counts before and after.
- Tests in your files before and after, and the `--fast` result.
- Each item of "The work": done, or left and why.
- Every split, as
  `<spec> RULE-<old> -> RULE-<a> (<claim>), RULE-<b> (<claim>)`, and every
  proof deleted, moved or re-pointed.
- Every word a person reads that you had to write and the contracts did not give.
- Every failure in a file you do not own.
- The self-check: each of its five results, and for the breaks, the test that failed.
