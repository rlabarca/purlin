# Architect Overrides: Sample Task Manager

> Project-specific rules for the Architect role in this sample project.

## Scope Restriction

This sample project contains exactly three feature specs:

- `arch_data_schema.md` (anchor node)
- `task_crud.md`
- `task_filtering.md`

Do not create additional features. The goal is to demonstrate the collaboration workflow, not to build a full application.

## Minimal Specs

Keep scenario sets minimal (3–6 scenarios per feature). The sample is for workflow demonstration, not exhaustive coverage.
