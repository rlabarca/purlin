# How We Work: Project-Specific Additions

> This file extends the base workflow philosophy from the framework.
> Add project-specific workflow rules, team conventions, and process additions below.

## Submodule Immutability (DO NOT REMOVE)
The `agentic-dev/` directory is a git submodule and a read-only dependency. No agent may create, modify, or delete any file inside it. All customizations go in this project's `.agentic_devops/` overrides, `features/`, and root-level scripts. See HOW_WE_WORK_BASE Section 6 for the full mandate.

## Project Workflow Additions
<!-- Add project-specific workflow rules or modifications here -->

## Team Conventions
<!-- Define any team-specific conventions, naming standards, or review protocols -->
