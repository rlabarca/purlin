# TOMBSTONE: release_process_animation_diagram_update

**Retired:** 2026-02-22
**Reason:** Feature retired by user request; the workflow animation is no longer part of the release process.

## Files to Delete

- `dev/generate_workflow_animation.py` — entire file (animation generator script)
- `assets/workflow-animation.gif` — entire file (generated animation artifact)
- `tests/release_process_animation_diagram_update/` — entire directory (test suite and results)
- `.agentic_devops/release/local_steps.json` — entire file (contained only the `workflow_animation` step)
- `.agentic_devops/release/config.json` — remove the `{"id": "workflow_animation", "enabled": false}` entry from the `steps` array

## Dependencies to Check

- `README.md` — may contain `![Purlin Agent Workflow](assets/workflow-animation.gif)` under the `## How It Works` heading; remove that line if present.

## Context

This feature specified a 16-frame animated GIF (`assets/workflow-animation.gif`) generated by `dev/generate_workflow_animation.py` using Mermaid CLI and ImageMagick. The animation illustrated the Purlin agent lifecycle (Architect, Builder, QA cycling through a feature). The release step was registered in `local_steps.json` and referenced in `config.json` (disabled). All implementation was in `dev/` (Purlin-dev-specific, not consumer-facing). The test suite in `tests/release_process_animation_diagram_update/` covered generator success, mmdc-absent error, README idempotency, and README insertion.
