# Implementation Notes: sync_upstream_deprecation

*   **[DISCOVERY]** [SPEC_PROPOSAL] This feature file should be retired or tombstoned. The deprecation work it describes is fully complete: `tools/sync_upstream.sh` was deleted in commit `922f313`, `/pl-update-purlin` is implemented and in TESTING, `features/submodule_sync.md` is marked REMOVED, and stale references were cleaned up in commit `fb5d4bd`. The file itself is a deprecation plan document (not a proper feature spec) — it lacks Overview, Requirements, and Scenarios sections, causing persistent Spec Gate and Implementation Gate FAILs in the Critic. Recommend the Architect either (a) tombstone/delete this feature file since it served its purpose as a planning artifact, or (b) mark it Complete if it should be preserved as historical record. Keeping it in its current state creates noise in the CDD dashboard with two permanent HIGH-priority false alarms. (Severity: HIGH)
