# Implementation Notes: Documentation Consistency Check

This step applies to user-facing documentation only. Feature specification files (`features/*.md`) are not "documentation" for the purposes of this step — they are the ground truth source, not the output being checked here.

For the Purlin framework repository, README.md is the primary documentation target. Consumer projects may also have documentation in `docs/` or equivalent locations.
