# Implementation Notes: Common Design Standards

*   Consumer projects MAY override these standards in their own `design_*.md` anchor node.
*   The standalone logo SVG (`assets/purlin-logo.svg`) uses dark-theme hex defaults. When embedded inline in tool HTML, the SVG elements use CSS classes that respond to the `data-theme` attribute for theme-responsive colors.
*   The FOUC prevention script must be placed before any `<link>` stylesheet tags to ensure the correct theme is applied before CSS renders.
