# Implementation Notes: Critic Consistency Check & README Update

This step is positioned immediately after `doc_consistency_framework` in Purlin's release config. The broader instruction-file consistency check runs first; this step then focuses narrowly on the Critic subsystem.

Phase 2 (README update) runs only after Phase 1 produces zero CRITICAL findings. A clean audit is a prerequisite for README publication.
