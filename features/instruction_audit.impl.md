# Implementation Notes: Purlin Agent Instruction Audit

This feature has no automated test coverage. Verification is performed by the Architect during the release process per the scenarios above. The QA column for this feature will always be `N/A`.

The audit scope covers only the four standard override files. Other files in `.purlin/` (e.g., `config.json`, `runtime/`, `cache/`) are out of scope for this step.
