Check for: direct contradictions between files, stale file path references, terminology mismatches, and lifecycle/protocol definitions that differ between the shared philosophy and role-specific instructions. Also verify that README.md and PROCESS_HISTORY.md are consistent with the current instruction file content. Fix any inconsistencies and commit."
